# Portfolio Source

Author - Connor Abdelnoor

#### Description

Repository storing source code for my [portfolio site](http://www.connorabdelnoor.com). The site is built with the [BackboneJS Framework](http://backbonejs.org/). It is designed to be a single web page utilizing Backbone to dynamically load content.

#### Project Dependencies

* [BackboneJS](http://backbonejs.org/)
* [Jquery](https://jquery.com/)
* [Underscore JS](http://underscorejs.org/)
* Gulp
* NPM

### Deployments

Because I am using shared hosting, I have not yet gone through the steps of installing Node.JS and NPM on my small section of a server. Instead, I decided just to track all my assets seeing as they are minimal anyway. Builds will done locally, tracked, and then pulled to the server through Github.

### Portfolio Projects
Each project is added as a [Git Submodule]https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules.
To add the submodules to the project, run these commands from the project root:

* `git submodule init`
* `git submodule update`
