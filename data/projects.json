    "long_description": "This program will recreate the classic game of minesweeper. As a user, you can click tiles to reveal either a bomb or a clue to the number of bombs in the tiles around it. The goal is to clear the entire board without flipping over a tile with a bomb. This ends the game. The program uses an Angular Factory to create the board and its various properties such as tiles, bombs, difficulty, and size. A controller handles the playing logic and includes one of my proudest accomplishments. A recursive function that reveals tiles and calculates appropriate clues.",

    "long_description": "This game challenges the user to chase an accelerating squid around the screen, accruing points for keeping the mouse in the target. It was built using the p5.js library. p5.js follows the goals of Java&#39;s processing library which attempts to make coding accessible to artists and designers. By adding vector properties to the squid object, and remembering some geometry from math class, it was possible to create a bouncing target. After adding some more logic for mouse events, and a score tracker, a nice little time wasting game was created.",
